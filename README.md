## Introduction

A design document (**DD**) is our way of defining a software system. It is an informal document that the primary author (or authors) of a software system create(s) before starting the actual coding. It is a high level implementation strategy that emphasizes the design decisions, and the trade-offs considered when making those decisions.

## Format

A DD is an informal document and thus, doesnâ€™t follow a strict guideline for its content. However, it must be written, by default, in narrative (descriptive) form using the English language.

For consistency though, try using the suggested format below:

## Length

A DD should be sufficiently detailed but short enough to actually be read by busy people. The sweet spot for a larger project might be around 10-20ish pages. If you get way beyond that, it might make sense to split up the problem into more manageable sub problems. It should also be noted that it is absolutely possible to write a 1-3 page DD, even a single-pager.
